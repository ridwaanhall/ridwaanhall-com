Over <span class='text-white'>1.9 million</span> people, 90% of the population, are displaced, scraping by in tents. And <span class='text-green-600'>60%+</span> of homes, schools, hospitals? Gone.

Gaza's infrastructure has collapsed nearly entirely—with 97% of water resources contaminated and undrinkable. The healthcare system operates at minimal capacity, with only 16 of 36 hospitals partially functioning as of May 2025. Average daily caloric intake has fallen to dangerous levels, with widespread malnutrition affecting over 31% of children under five."
