The Presidential Council for Religious Harmony actively promotes understanding between different faiths, while Muslims, Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, and followers of other religions coexist peacefully.

The compact city-state can feel crowded, and its strict regulatory environment extends to personal freedoms—from chewing gum bans to severe penalties for minor offenses. Work culture tends toward long hours, and the competitive environment creates significant pressure. Permanent residency and citizenship have become increasingly difficult to obtain, with strict quotas in place."

The language barrier remains substantial, and social integration can be difficult for foreigners. Korea's homogeneous culture sometimes manifests as subtle discrimination against Southeast Asians. Weather extremes—from humid summers to freezing winters—can be challenging for those accustomed to Indonesia's tropical climate. The high population density in Seoul means housing is expensive and often limited in size."
