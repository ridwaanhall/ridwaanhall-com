Enter time management hacks like Pomodoro—25 minutes of pure focus, 5-minute breather. It's like a gym sesh for your brain, keeping you sharp without crashing.</p>", "<h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl text-medium mt-4 md:mt-5 mb-2 md:mb-3'>Timeboxing for Developer Productivity</h2>", "<p class='mb-4 text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg'>Try timeboxing: give a task (say, debugging an API) 2 hours max. No perfectionism—ship it and move on. Tools like Trello or Notion keep your tasks in check; I use them to juggle ML projects and blog posts without losing my mind.</p>", "<h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl text-medium mt-4 md:mt-5 mb-2 md:mb-3'>Eliminating Developer Distractions</h2>", "<p class='mb-4 text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg'>Distractions are the enemy. Mute Slack, ditch social media, and pop on lo-fi beats—focus mode activated. Set hard boundaries: no coding past 9 PM unless it's crunch time. That way, you've got juice for gaming, fam, or just chilling.</p>", "<h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl text-medium mt-4 md:mt-5 mb-2 md:mb-3'>Strategic Weekly Planning</h2>", "<p class='mb-4 text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg'>Plan your week like a boss—Sunday nights, I map out big wins (like finishing a Django view) and small stuff (emails). Prioritize what moves the needle; skip the busywork. Bonus: track time with Toggl to see where you're slacking.</p>", "<h2 class='text-xl lg:text-2xl text-medium mt-4 md:mt-5 mb-2 md:mb-3'>Preventing Burnout with Intentional Rest</h2>", "<p class='mb-4 text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg'>Burnout's real, so take breaks seriously—walk, stretch, or pray to reset. I've dodged crashes by mixing coding sprints with downtime. Test these hacks for a week, tweak what works, and you'll be shipping code like a pro with time to spare.</p>"],
